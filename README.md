## Project Overview
SMART_PG_FINDER_SYSTEM is a web-based platform designed to simplify the process of finding Paying Guest (PG) accommodations. The system connects PG owners and tenants through a simple and structured interface.

## Existing Features
- User registration and login for PG owners  
- PG owners can add PG details such as name, location, rent, contact number, and facilities  
- Tenants can view available PG listings  
- Separate owner and tenant views  
- Data handled through a backend API with JSON-based storage  

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js  
- Storage: JSON-based local storage  
- Deployment Platform: Render  

## Deployment
The complete project (frontend and backend) is deployed on Render using the free tier.  
Since it is hosted on the free plan, the server may go inactive after a period of inactivity and can take a few minutes to restart when accessed again.

## Demonstration
The project is demonstrated using the live Render deployment, showing PG listings, owner login, and basic operations performed by the owner.

## GitHub Repository
The complete source code for both frontend and backend is available in this repository.
